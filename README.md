Polynomial Project
Description: You will design and implement a Data Structure for Polynomial Representation, Arithmetic, and Evaluation. 
The implementation should allow for basic arithmetic operations and evaluation. The details of the design of the structure
is largely at your discretion. Major factors to consider for the design should be theoretical eﬃciency (both time and space),
practical eﬃciency, and appropriate memory management. Although some tips are provided below (and have been provided in class), 
the determination of how to make the structure eﬃcient is largely your charge.

Implementation Note: I used Sparse Matrices to represent each term of the polynomial
